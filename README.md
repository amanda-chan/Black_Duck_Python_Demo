# Black Duck Vulnerability Scan Demo - Python Project

This repository contains a simple Python project that demonstrates the integration of Black Duck with Jenkins to scan for security vulnerabilities and license compliance issues in open-source dependencies.

## Project Description

The project consists of a Python script (`app.py`) that fetches data from a public API and prints the titles of posts. The project uses a `requirements.txt` file to list its dependencies, some of which include known vulnerabilities for testing purposes. The Black Duck plugin will be used in Jenkins to scan these dependencies and identify any security or compliance risks.
